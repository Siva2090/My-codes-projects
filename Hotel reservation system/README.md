# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System using Java

This is a **Hotel Reservation System** developed using **Core Java**. It allows users to manage hotel reservations with a basic console interface. This project is a great starting point for Java beginners who want to practice Java and connect it with a database like **MySQL**.

## 📌 About the Project

This project includes:
- Java code to run hotel reservation logic
- A MySQL database file (`hotel_reservation.sql`)
- Future plans to add JDBC database connectivity

Right now, it works as a **basic Java project**, and later you'll upgrade it to use JDBC to interact with MySQL.
